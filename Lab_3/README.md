## Requirements
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a Python class that simulates a Stack. The class should implement methods like push, pop, peek (the last two methods should return None if no element is present in the stack).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a Python class that simulates a Queue. The class should implement methods like push, pop, peek (the last two methods should return None if no element is present in the queue).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a Python class that simulates a matrix of size <code class="hljs">N</code>x<code class="hljs">M</code>, with <code class="hljs">N</code> and <code class="hljs">M</code> provided at initialization. The class should provide methods to access elements (get and set methods) and some methematical functions such as transpose, matrix multiplication and a method that allows iterating through all elements form a matrix an apply a transformation over them (via a lambda function).</p>
